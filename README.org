This repository contains my personal dotfiles and *GNU Guix Home* config.

* Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles are organized using a layout compatible with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html#Introduction][GNU Stow]].

Each subdirectory here represents a *"package"* of configuration files,
automatically linked into =~= via the =home-dotfiles-service-type=.

** Directory Mapping Example

| Source                                      | Dest in =$HOME=                          |
|------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------|
| =dotfiles/hyprland/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf=       | =~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf=           |
| =dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc=                                | =~/.zshrc=                               |
| =dotfiles/rofi/.local/share/rofi/themes/custom.rasi= | =~/.local/share/rofi/themes/custom.rasi= |

** Usage

*** Guix Home

#+begin_src scheme
  (service home-dotfiles-service-type
  	 (home-dotfiles-configuration
  	  (directories '("./dotfiles"))
  	  (layout 'stow)
  	  (packages '("zsh" "hyprland" "other-package-name"))))
#+end_src

*** GNU Stow (recommended on non-Guix)

#+begin_src sh
  cd dotfiles
  stow hyprland zsh other-package-name -t ~
#+end_src

*** Manual Copying

#+begin_src sh
  cp dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
  cp dotfiles/hyprland/.* ~ -r
  cp dotfiles/rofi/.local/share/rofi/themes/custom.rasi ~/.local/share/rofi/themes/custom.rasi
#+end_src
